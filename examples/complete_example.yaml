module_custom_instructions:
  question_categorization: |
    - If the user asks about revenue without specifying a time period, ask them to clarify the date range.
    - Reject questions about individual customer credit card information. Ask users to contact their admin.
  sql_generation: |
    When analyzing revenue, always exclude cancelled orders unless explicitly requested.
    Customer segments should be capitalized consistently.
    All monetary values are in USD and should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
